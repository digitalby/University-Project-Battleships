# Android Battleships (University Project)

![screenshot][screenshot]

The end goal of the assignment was to create an online battleships game for Android, with Firebase acting as a backend replacement, and one of the player's devices acting as a server and a "source of truth".

The project has been created in less than 48 hours. 

The project is a work in progress and requires cleanup & polishing.
